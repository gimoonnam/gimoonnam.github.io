# Univariate Linear Regression (ULR) 

In this post, I study a Linear Regression(LR), which is a basic subject in Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. A single variable LR is considered. I will implement the LR with three different tools: Numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, and their results will be compared to each other. 

## Hypothesis and loss function 




## Implementation 

### ULR with Numpy as ***from-scratch*** approach






### ULR with Tensorflow 2.0 





### ULR with Keras 





# Concluding remarks
