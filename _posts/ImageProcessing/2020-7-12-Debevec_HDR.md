# Introduction 
 
 ... 
 
## What is High Dynamic Range(HDR)? 
 ...  
    
## Camera Response Function(CRF)

* the film reponse to variations in exposure $X$ is a non-linear function, called "characteristic curve" of the film, 
      accounting for a non-linear relationship between pixel exposure $X$ and its intensity $Z$

* To cover the full dynamic range, one can take a series of photographs with different exposures, 
      raising a question on **how to combine these separate images into a composite radiance map**
