## Laplace of Gaussian 



## Unsharp Filter

The unsharp filter is also used to enhance edges and other details on images. As one of spatial sharpening, the principle is pretty much similar to that of DoG.  
A smoothed image is subtracted from its original one, which produces a high-pass signal's edge image. 

$$
g(x,y) = f(x,y) - f_{\mathrm{smoothed}}(x,y)
\tag{1}
$$

where $f(x,y)$ is an original image and $g(x,y)$ denotes the edge image. 


A better understanding can be made in a signal pattern as shown below.

|taken from Ref.3: The bottom panel (c) is obtained by subtracting (b) from (a).|


The resultant sharpened image can then be obtained by adding the edge image to the original one:  

$$
f_{\mathrm{sharp}}(x,y) = f(x,y) + kg(x,y)
\tag{2}
$$

where $k$ is a scaling constant, typically set from the range between 0.2 and 0.7. The sharpness of an image becomes enhanced as $k$ increases.
