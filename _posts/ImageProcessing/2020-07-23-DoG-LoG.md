# Introduction 

In this post, we will look over how to improve edges and other detailedd features on images. There are several methods, most of which uses convolutions with a filter. 

## 1. Laplace Operator 

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{L} &=& \nabla^2 f(x,y) \nonumber\\
&=& \left[\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}  \right] f(x,y) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{1}
$$

where $f(x,y)$ denotes a 2-D intensity map of original image, where $x,y$ indicate a coordinate of pixels on the images. 



## 2. Difference of Gaussian (DoG)  

$$
G_1(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_1}}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma_{1}^2\right)\nonumber\\ 
G_2(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_2}}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma_{2}^2\right)\nonumber
\tag{2} 
$$

These two Gaussian filter produces two blurred images. Differencce of Gaussians is then made by subtracting more blurred image from less blurred one, 
ensuring that $\sigma_1 < \sigma_2$. 

$$
f_{\mathrm{sharpened}}(x,y) = f(x,y)* G_1(x,y) - f(x,y) * G_2(x,y)
\tag{3}
$$

where $* $ indicates convolution operator. 


The resulting curve resembles a Mexican hat as shown below.

## 3. Laplace of Gaussian (LoG)

Thesecond one is the Laplace of Gaussian, in which Gaussian filter is applied to Laplacian operator as shown below. 

$$ 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{LoG} &=& \nabla^2 G(x,y) \nonumber\\
&=& -\frac{1}{\pi \sigma^2}\left[ 1- \frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2} \right] \mathrm{e} ^{-\left(x^2+y^2\right)/2\sigma^2}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{4}
$$

Aa aforementioned, the Laplacian filter is very sensitive to noise despite a better performancce on edge detection. 
These counterpart properties are resolved by applying Laplace operator to Gaussian blurred image that has already removed noise by blurring. 
LoG is more widely used to sharpen images than Laplace and DoG. 


## 4. Unsharp Filter 

The unsharp filter is also used to enhance edges and other details on images. As one of spatial sharpening, the principle is pretty much similar to that of DoG.  
A smoothed image is subtracted from its original one, which produces a high-pass signal's edge image. 

$$
g(x,y) = f(x,y) - f_{\mathrm{smoothed}}(x,y)
\tag{5}
$$

where $g(x,y)$ denotes the edge image. 


A better understanding can be made in a signal pattern as shown below.

|taken from Ref.3: The bottom panel (c) is obtained by subtracting (b) from (a).|


The resultant sharpened image can then be obtained by adding the edge image to the original one:  

$$
f_{\mathrm{sharp}}(x,y) = f(x,y) + kg(x,y)
\tag{6}
$$

where $k$ is a scaling constant, typically set from the range between 0.2 and 0.7. The sharpness of an image becomes enhanced as $k$ increases.
