# How to Initialize Dictionary to zeros 

Here, let me introduce one way to initialize a dictionary variale in python, which is made by using get() method. 
A dictionary has a data type of  {key: value}. When you want to count the occurrence of each key in a given list, 
then firs the all values need to be set to zero. 

The get() method for dictionary is defined as follow 

```
dict.get(key, default = None)
```

where key is the key variable of dictionary, whose value will be assigned as a default if the default is given, 
otherwise be assigned as a preassigned value. The below example shows this implementation. 


## Examples of get() method 

```
dict = {'Name': 'Zabra', 'Age': 7}
print ("Value : %s" %  dict.get('Age'))  
==> dict['Age'] = 7 because it default is not given 

print ("Value : %s" %  dict.get('Education', "Never"))
===> dict['Education'] = Never 
```

## Initialize dictionary by get() method 

The below code initialize my_dict with zeros for all keys. 

```
nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3] # given list 

my_dict={} # declare a dictionary 
 
for n in nums: 
    my_dict[n] = my_dict.get(n, 0) # default 0 will be assigned to all values 
print(my_dict)
```


We can count the occurrence of each keys while initializing, which is shown in the following code. 
The only difference from the above code is the addition of **+1** at the end of get(n,0) method. 

```
nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
 
my_dict={}
for n in nums:
    my_dict[n] = my_dict.get(n, 0)+1  
 
print(my_dict)
 

Output: 
my_dict = {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2}

```

The output is obtained as expected.
